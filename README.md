# Shor's Algorithm Implementation

A quantum computing implementation of Shor's algorithm using qiskit (Quantum Toolbox in Python) for integer factorization.

## Requirements

- python 3.12

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```bash
python main.py #produces output.csv
python grapher.py #requires output.csv to exist
```

## Limitations

- Educational implementation suitable for small numbers
- Requires significant computational resources
- May need multiple runs for successful factorization
